Welcome to 
\emph on
Exploring Lift
\emph default
.
 We've created this book to educate you about Lift, which we think is a
 great framework for building compelling web applications.
 Lift is designed to make powerful techniques easily accessible while keeping
 the overall framework simple and flexible.
 It may sound like a clich

, but in our experience Lift makes it fun to develop because it lets you
 focus on the interesting parts of coding.
 Our goal for this book is that by the end, you'll be able to create and
 extend any web application you can think of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Why Lift?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those of you have experience with other web frameworks such as Struts,
 Tapestry, Rails, et cetera, you must be asking yourself, "Why another framework
? Does Lift really solve problems any differently or more effectively than
 the ones I've used before?" Based on our experience (and that of others
 in the growing Lift community), the answer is an emphatic, "Yes!" Lift
 has cherry-picked the best ideas from a number of other frameworks, while
 creating some novel ideas of its own.
 It's this combination of a solid foundation and new techniques that makes
 Lift so powerful.
 At the same time, Lift has been able to avoid the mistakes made in the
 past by other frameworks.
 In the spirit of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

convention over configuration,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lift has sensible defaults for everything while making it easy to customize
 precisely what you need to: no more and no less.
 Gone are the days of XML file after XML file providing 
\emph on
basic configuration
\emph default
 for your application.
 Instead, a simple Lift app requires only that you add the LiftFilter to
 your web.xml and add one or more lines telling Lift what package your classes
 sit in (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Bootstrap"

\end_inset

).
 The methods you code aren't required to implement a specific interface
 (called a trait), although there are support traits that make things that
 much simpler.
 In short, you don't need to write anything that isn't explicitly necessary
 for the task at hand.
 Lift is intended to work out of the box, and to make you as efficient and
 productive as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key strengths of Lift is the clean separation of presentation
 content and logic, based on the bedrock concept of the Model-View-Controller
\begin_inset Index

 pattern

.
 One of the original Java web application technologies that's still in use
 today is JSP, or Java Server Pages
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 JSP allows you to mix HTML and Java code directly within the page.
 While this may have seemed like a good idea at the start, it has proven
 to be painful in practice.
 Putting code in your presentation layer makes it more difficult to debug
 and understand what is going on within a page, and makes it more difficult
 for the people writing the HTML portion because the contents aren't valid
 HTML.
 While many modern programming and HTML editors have been modified to accomodate
 this mess, proper syntax highlighting and validation don't make up for
 having to switch back and forth between one or more files to follow the
 page flow.
 Lift takes the approach that there should be no code in the presentation
 layer, but that the presentation layer has to be flexible enough to accomodate
 any conceivable use.
 To that end, Lift uses a powerful templating system, à la Wicket
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://wicket.apache.org/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, to bind user-generated data into the presentation layer.
 Lift's templating is built on the XML processing capabilities of the Scala
 language
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Not only does Scala have extensive library support for XML, but XML syntax
 is actually part of the language.
 We'll cover this in more detail as we go through the book.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and allows such things as nested templates, simple injection of user-generated
 content, and advanced data binding capabilities.
 For those coming from JSP, Lift's advanced template and XML processing
 allows you essentially to write custom tag libraries at a fraction of the
 cost in time and effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lift has another advantage over many other web frameworks: it's designed
 specifically to leverage the Scala
\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Scala
\end_layout

\end_inset

 programming language.
 Scala is a relatively new language developed by Martin Odersky
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Martin created the Pizza programming language, which led to the Generic
 Java (GJ) project that was eventually incorporated into Java 1.5.
 His home page is at

\end_inset

 and his programming language research group at EPFL Switzerland.
 It compiles to Java bytecode and runs on the JVM, which means that you
 can leverage the vast ecosystem of Java libraries just as you would with
 any other Java web framework.
 At the same time, Scala introduces some very powerful features designed
 to make you, the developer, more productive.
 Among these features are an extremely rich type system along with powerful
 type inference, native XML processing, full support for closures and functions
 as objects, and an extensive high-level library.
 The power of the type system together with type inference has led people
 to call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the statically-typed dynamic language

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 That means you can write code as quickly as you can with dynamically-typed
 languages (e.g.
 Python, Ruby, etc.), but you have the compile-time type safety of a statically-t
yped language such as Java.
 Scala is also a hybrid functional (FP) and object-oriented (OO) language,
 which means that you can get the power of higher-level functional languages
 such as Haskell or Scheme while retaining the modularity and reusability
 of OO components.
 In particular, the FP concept of immutability is encouraged by Scala, making
 it well-suited for writing highly-concurrent programs that achieve high
 throughput scalability.
 The hybrid model also means that if you haven't touched FP before, you
 can gradually ease into it.
 In our experience, Scala allows you to do more in Lift with fewer lines
 of code.
 Remember, Lift is all about making you more productive!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lift strives to encompass advanced features in a very concise and straightforwar
d manner.
 Lift's powerful support for AJAX and Comet allows you to use Web 2.0 features
 with very little effort.
 Lift leverages Scala's Actor library to provide a message-driven framework
 for Comet updates.
 In most cases, adding Comet support to a page involves nothing more than
 extending a trait
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A trait is a Scala construct that's almost like a Java interface.
 The main difference is that traits may implement methods and have fields.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to define the rendering method of your page and adding an extra function
 call to your links to dispatch the update message.
 Lift handles all of the back-end and page-side coding to provide the Comet
 polling.
 AJAX support includes special handlers for doing AJAX form submission via
 JSON, and almost any link function can easily be turned into an AJAX version
 with a few keystrokes.
 In order to perform all of this client-side goodness, Lift has a class
 hierarchy for encapsulating JavaScript calls via direct JavaScript, jQuery,
 and YUI.
 The nice part is that you, too, can utilize these support classes so that
 code can be generated for you and you don't have to put JavaScript logic
 into your templates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What You Should Know before Starting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First and foremost, this is a book on the Lift framework.
 There are several things we expect you to be familiar with before continuing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Scala language and standard library.
 This book is not intended to be an introduction to Scala: there are several
 very good books available that fill that role.
 You can find a list of Scala books at the Scala website, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.scala-lang.org/node/959"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTML and XML.
 Lift relies heavily on XHTML for its template support, so you should understand
 such things as DocTypes, elements, attributes, and namespaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
General HTTP processing, including GET and POST submission, response codes,
 and content types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Typographical Conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better communicate concepts and techniques in this book, we
 have adopted the following typographical conventions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter

 Monospaced typewriter text is used to indicate types, class names, and
 other code-related information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List

 Ellipses within code listings are used to indicate omission of code to
 condense listings.
 Unless otherwise noted, the example code in this book comes from the PocketChan

 Recently Scala's compiler was changed to target Java version 1.5.
 Version 1.4 is still available as a target, but we're going to assume you're
 using 1.5.
 Examples in this book have only been tested with Sun's version of the JDK,
 although most likely other versions (e.g.
 Blackdown or OpenJDK) should work with little or no modification.

Now that we have the prerequisites out of the way, it's time to get started.
 We're going to leverage Maven's archetypes
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An archetype is essentially a project template for Maven that provides prompt-dr
iven customization of basic attributes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to do 99% of the work for us in this example.
 First, change to whatever directory you'd like to work in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we use Maven's 
\family typewriter
archetype:generate
\family default
 command to create the skeleton of our project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
mvn archetype:generate -U 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  -DarchetypeGroupId=net.liftweb

Maven should output several pages of text.
 It may stop and ask you to confirm the properties configuration, in which
 case you can just hit 
\family typewriter

 At the end you should get a message that says 
\family typewriter

 You've now successfully created your first project! Don't believe us? Let's
 run it to confirm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd helloworld
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
mvn jetty:run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maven should produce more output, ending with
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

) running on port 8080 of your machine.
 Just go to 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://localhost:8080/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and you'll see your first Lift page, the standard 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello, world!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 With just a few simple commands, we've built a functional (albeit limited)
 web app.
 Let's go into a little more detail and see exactly how these pieces fit
 together.
 First, let's examine the index page.
 Whenever Lift serves up a request in which the URL ends with a forward
 slash, Lift automatically looks for a file called 
\family typewriter
index.html
\family default

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Technically, it also searches for some variations on index.html, including
 any localized versions of the page, but we'll cover that later in section
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO: Need a cross reference here
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 in that directory.
 For instance, if you tried to go to 
\family typewriter
http://localhost:8080/test/
\family default
, Lift would look for 
\family typewriter
index.html
\family default
 under the 
\family typewriter
test/
\family default
 directory in your project.
 The HTML sources will be located under 
\family typewriter
src/main/webapp/
\family default
 in your project directory.
 Here's the 
\family typewriter
index.html
\family default
 file from our Hello World project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},frame=lines,language=XML"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<lift:surround with="default" at="content">
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  <h2>Welcome to your project!</h2>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  <p><lift:helloWorld.howdy /></p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</lift:surround>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may look a little strange at first.
 For those with some XML experience, you may recognize the use of prefixed
 elements here.
 For those who don't know what a prefixed element is, it's an XML element
 of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<prefix:element>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our case we have two elements in use: 
\family typewriter
<lift:surround>
\family default
 and
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

<lift:helloWorld.howdy />
\family default
.
 Lift assigns special meaning to elements that use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prefix: they form the basis of lift's extensive templating support, which
 we will cover in more detail in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Templates"

\end_inset

.
 When lift processes an XML template
\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
template
\end_layout

\end_inset

, it does so from the outermost element inward.
 In our case, the outermost element is 
\family typewriter
<lift:surround with=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

default
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

content
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

>
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
<lift:surround>
\family default
 element basically tells Lift to find the template named by the 
\emph on
with
\emph default
 attribute (
\emph on
default
\emph default
, in our case) and to put the contents of our element inside of that template.
 The 
\emph on
at
\emph default
 attribute tells Lift where in the template to place our content.
 In Lift, this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filling in the blanks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is called 
\emph on
binding
\emph default

\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
binding
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and it's a fundamental concept of Lift's template system.
 Just about everything at the HTML/XML level can be thought of as a series
 of nested binds.
 Before we move on to the 
\family typewriter
<lift:helloWorld.howdy/>
\family default
 element, let's look at the default template.
 You can find it in the 
\family typewriter
templates-hidden
\family default
 directory of the web app.
 Much like the 
\family typewriter
WEB-INF
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
META-INF
\family default
 directories in a Java web application, the contents of 
\family typewriter
templates-hidden
\family default
 cannot be accessed directly by clients; they can, however, be accessed
 when they're referenced by a 
\family typewriter
<lift:surround>
\family default
 element.
 Here is the 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see in the listing, this is a proper XHTML file, with 
\family typewriter
<html>
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
<body>
\family default
 tags.
 This is required since Lift doesn't add these itself.
 Lift simply processes the XML from each template it encounters.
 The 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
 element and its contents are boilerplate; the interesting things happen
 inside the 
\family typewriter
<body>
\family default
 element.
 There are three elements here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
<lift:bind name=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

content
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 />
\family default
 element determines where the contents of our 
\family typewriter
index.html
\family default
 file are bound (inserted).
 The 
\emph on
name
\emph default
 attribute should match the corresponding 
\emph on
at
\emph default
 attribute from our 
\family typewriter
<lift:surround>
\family default
 element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
<lift:Menu.builder />
\family default
 element is a special element that builds a menu based on the SiteMap
\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SiteMap
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (to be covered in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:SiteMap"

\end_inset

).
 The SiteMap is a high-level site directory component that not only provides
 a centralized place to define a site menu, but allows you to control when
 certain links are displayed (based on, say, whether users are logged in
 or what roles they have) and provides a page-level access control mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
<lift:msgs />
\family default
 element allows Lift (or your code) to display messages on a page as it's
 rendered.
 These could be status messages, error messages, etc.
 Lift has facilities to set one or more messages from inside your logic
 code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's look back at the 
\family typewriter
<lift:helloWorld.howdy />
\family default
 element from the 
\family typewriter
index.html
\family default
 file.
 This element (and the 
\family typewriter
<lift:Menu.builder />
\family default
 element, actually) is called a 
\emph on
snippet
\emph default
, and it's of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<lift:class.method>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\family typewriter
class
\family default
 is the name of a Scala class defined in our project in the 
\family typewriter
demo.helloworld.snippets
\family default
 package and 
\family typewriter
method
\family default
 is a method defined on that class.
 Lift does a little translation on the class name to change camel-case back
 into title-case and then locates the class.
 In our demo the class is located under 
\family typewriter
src/main/scala/demo/helloworld/snippet/HelloWorld.scala
\family default
, and is shown here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

package demo.helloworld.snippet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class HelloWorld {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  def howdy = <span>Welcome to helloworld at 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    {new _root_.java.util.Date}</span>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, the howdy method is pretty straightforward.
 Lift binds the result of executing the method (in this case a 
\family typewriter
span
\family default
) into the location of the snippet element.
 It's interesting to note that a method may itself return other 
\family typewriter
<lift:...>
\family default
 elements in its content and they will be processed as well.
 This recursive nature of template composition is part of the fundamental
 power of Lift; it means that reusing snippets and template pieces across
 your application is essentially free.
 You should never have to write the same functionality more than once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've covered all of the actual content elements, the final piece
 of the puzzle is the 
\family typewriter
Boot
\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Boot
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 class.
 The 
\family typewriter
Boot
\family default
 class is responsible for the configuration and setup of the Lift framework.
 As we've stated earlier in the chapter, most of Lift has sensible defaults,
 so the 
\family typewriter
Boot
\family default
 class generally contains only the extras that you need.
 The 
\family typewriter
Boot
\family default
 class is always located in the 
\family typewriter
bootstrap.liftweb
\family default
 package and is shown here (we've skipped imports, etc):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

inline false

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic configuration elements, placed in the 
\family typewriter
boot 
\family default
method.
 The first is the 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
LiftRules.addToPackages
\family default
 method.
 It tells lift to base its searches in the 
\family typewriter
demo.helloworld
\family default
 package.
 That means that snippets would be located in the 
\family typewriter
demo.helloworld.snippets
\family default
 package, views (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Views"

\end_inset

) would be located in the 
\family typewriter
demo.helloworld.views
\family default
 package, etc.
 If you have more than one hierarchy (i.e.
 multiple packages), you can just call 
\family typewriter
addToPackages
\family default
 multiple times.
 The second item in the Boot class is the SiteMenu setup.
 Obviously this is a pretty simple menu in this demo, but we'll cover more
 interesting examples in the SiteMap chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've covered a basic example we hope you're beginning to see why
 Lift is so powerful and why it can make you more productive.
 We've barely scratched the surface of Lift's templating and binding capabilitie
s, but what we've shown here is already a big step.
 In roughly ten lines of Scala code and about thirty in XML, we have a functiona
l site.
 If we wanted to add more pages, we've already got our default template
 set up so we don't need to write the same boilerplate HTML multiple times.
 In our example we're directly generating the content for our 
\family typewriter
helloWorld.howdy
\family default
 snippet, but in later examples we'll show just how easy it is to pull content
 
\emph on
from the template itself
\emph default
 into the snippet and modify it as needed.
